## Who Will Use:

- Users who want to keep track of what shows they are watching and what season and episode they are currently on
- Users who want to make a to-watch list 
- Users interested in marking what shows are their favourite shows

## Why Project is of Interest:
I am interested in keeping track of shows I have already watched or am currently watching, as well as give a rating to 
the show to express how much I enjoyed it. I would like to save shows by personal favourite. This application will be
useful to me because if I ever want to remember which shows I have seen, and if they were shows I was entertained by, I
can simply refer back to the TV Show Tracker, especially if the amount of shows I've seen start accumulating, and I 
start to forget some even existed.
